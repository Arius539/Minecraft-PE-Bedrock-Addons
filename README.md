# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the **Minecraft-PE-Bedrock-Addons** repository‚Äîa comprehensive collection of JavaScript scripts tailored for enhancing *Minecraft Pocket Edition* and *Bedrock Edition*. This project is designed to empower developers and enthusiasts alike by providing a modular, well-documented toolkit for creating and integrating custom add-ons.

## Key Features

- **Modular Structure:** Easily integrate and extend functionalities.
- **Efficiency & Scalability:** Optimized for performance with modern coding standards.
- **Robust Documentation:** Clear explanations and examples for beginners and advanced users.
- **Community-Driven:** Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged.

The development approach is rooted in scientific rigor and best practices, ensuring that every contribution is robust, extensible, and maintainable. Whether you are a beginner seeking to understand the fundamentals of Minecraft scripting or an advanced developer pushing the boundaries of game modding, this repository provides a solid foundation for exploration and innovation.

# üóÉÔ∏è Advanced Dynamic Data Storage for Minecraft PE

This module provides a comprehensive, production-ready system for persisting and restoring arbitrary JavaScript objects in Minecraft Bedrock‚Äôs Dynamic Properties, with full support for deep or cyclic object graphs.

**Highlights:**

- **Recursive Object-Graph Serialization**  
  Transparently traverses any object tree‚Äîprimitives, nested objects, Arrays, Maps, Sets or custom classes‚Äîand records every field under a compact key hierarchy.

- **Circular-Reference & Deduplication**  
  Automatically detects duplicate or cyclic references and emits lightweight pointer-objects instead of re-serializing, ensuring both correctness and minimal storage footprint.

- **Type-Aware, Custom Serialization**  
  Built-in handlers for Arrays, Maps and Sets capture lengths, sizes and element entries in a form that guarantees faithful reconstruction, including prototype and method preservation.

- **Key Abbreviation & Ignoring**  
  Replaces verbose property names with short codes and omits irrelevant or regenerable fields (e.g. dynamic caches), reducing both memory usage and I/O overhead.

- **Error Isolation & Diagnostics**  
  Each save/load step is wrapped in try/catch blocks with contextual logging, so individual failures don‚Äôt derange the overall persistence process.

- **Central Class Registry**  
  Maps string-identifiers to constructors, enabling seamless instantiation of custom classes when loading‚Äîmethods and prototypes remain intact.
